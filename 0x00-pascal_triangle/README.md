Pascal's triangle


Pascal's triangle, in algebra, a triangular arrangement of numbers that gives the coefficients in the expansion of any binomial expression, such as (x + y)n. It is named for the 17th-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal, but it is far older.

Pascal's triangle is important because it contains numerous patterns that can be used to make complex calculations much easier.

Pascal's triangle formula is (n+1)C(r) = (n)C(r - 1) + (n)C(r). It means that the number of ways to choose r items out of a total of n + 1 items is the same as adding the number of ways to choose r - 1 items out of a total of n items and the number of ways to choose r items out of a total of n items.

Pascal's Triangle (Definition, History, Formula & Properties)
Pascal's triangle is the triangular array of numbers that begins with 1 on the top and with 1's running down the two sides of a triangle. Each new number lies between two numbers and below them, and its value is the sum of the two numbers above it.
